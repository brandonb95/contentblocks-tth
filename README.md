# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Approach & Challenges

For this project brief, I attempted to prioritize function over form, as the scope of this entire project was something I have previously been unfamiliar with (working within the Clerk environment). I began by instating the login functionality as it was the most important, then created the "Forgot Password" magic link function. Learning the ins and outs of Clerk was challenging, especially as I was developing in the React environment and not in Next.js. I found it difficult to implement some functions, and struggled to find several solutions within the documentation. I am missing only 2 requirements (part of the registration and the password hashing). I continuously ran into Error 422 for both requirements and began to move to other parts of the brief. As the deadline passes, I am going to continue to try to figure out the dreaded error message and how to resolve it.

I initially created the ability to change the password within the form, but opted to leave that out for the sake of this project. The design was the most enjoyable, creating my form and maintaining the styling very similar to the existing flow. I regretfully ran into personal problems last week which delayed my timeline, but I feel I did the best I could in the time that I had.
